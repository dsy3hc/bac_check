{"name":"Bac Check","tagline":"","body":"### BAC Check\r\nBAC Check (temporary name for now) is a simple web and mobile application that will allow users to get a rough estimate of their Blood Alcohol Content by taking in the user's gender, weight, drinks consumed, and time spent drinking. It does not promise to be 100% accurate since there are other factors that cannot be accounted for such as the amount and type of food consumed throughout the day as well as the user's genetics\r\n\r\nThe proposed plan is to have two modes: quick check and party mode. Quick check is intended to give users a simple way to calculate their estimated BAC by providing a minimal and simple design. It is a one time check that takes in all the variables at once which are entered by the user. \r\nParty mode keeps a running timer in order to calculate the time variable. The user hits start and adds in the drinks while the mode is running. Unlike quick check, adding a drink will be more detailed and ask for the type of alcohol, amount consumed, and alcohol percentage. BAC can be calculated at any time when the user hits a button which takes the current time and subtracts it from the start time. From there they can either end the session or resume the session to continue adding drinks.\r\n\r\nPossible additions to the plan will be a graphical view of the user's BAC when calculated to show what their BAC will be approximately at what time and when it will be close to 0 as well as letting users create accounts which can save statistics such as total drinks consumed when using the app, average BAC when drinking, and time spent drinking.\r\n\r\nBAC Check will be implemented as an Android app and an Angular JS application for the web.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
