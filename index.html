<p>BAC Check (temporary name for now) is a simple web and mobile application that will allow users to get a rough estimate of their Blood Alcohol Content by taking in the user's gender, weight, drinks consumed, and time spent drinking. It does not promise to be 100% accurate since there are other factors that cannot be accounted for such as the amount and type of food consumed throughout the day as well as the user's genetics</p>

<p>The proposed plan is to have two modes: quick check and party mode. Quick check is intended to give users a simple way to calculate their estimated BAC by providing a minimal and simple design. It is a one time check that takes in all the variables at once which are entered by the user. 
Party mode keeps a running timer in order to calculate the time variable. The user hits start and adds in the drinks while the mode is running. Unlike quick check, adding a drink will be more detailed and ask for the type of alcohol, amount consumed, and alcohol percentage. BAC can be calculated at any time when the user hits a button which takes the current time and subtracts it from the start time. From there they can either end the session or resume the session to continue adding drinks.</p>

<p>Possible additions to the plan will be a graphical view of the user's BAC when calculated to show what their BAC will be approximately at what time and when it will be close to 0 as well as letting users create accounts which can save statistics such as total drinks consumed when using the app, average BAC when drinking, and time spent drinking.</p>

<p>BAC Check will be implemented as an Android app and an Angular JS application for the web.</p>
