# BacToDriving
The purpose of this application is to provide users with an estimate of their blood alcohol content
while during a night out of drinking. The estimate is just rough and only uses an equation based solely
on gender, weight, and duration period since there are so many factors such as genetics and food consumption
that cannot be measured in order to give an exact estimate of one's BAC. The design is meant to be simple as not
to disturb the user with too many options so they do not feel like it is too much of a hassle to use and decide
not to use it. There are two modes with the application: Quick Check just takes in the three variables listed above
to give a quick estimate of one's BAC. Party Mode lets the user start the event and it will keep running in the background
as the user inputs drinks as they are consumed. In addition to providing BAC, the application will also give estimates
as to when the user's BAC will be below the legal driving limit and how long until they are sober again. These 
estimates will be given in a date time format in case the users are intending to drive and want to know approximately
how long they should wait.
